# Tab Overload

This is hacked together, quick and dirty browser extension that tries to help me save myself from tab bankruptcy.
IDK about you, but I have a problem with tabs.
I need something to help me get find and rid of the crap I'm not using.

I've explored other solutions including previous efforts to write my own tab manager, but right now I just need something that will help automate the process of cleaning up all the crap.
That's where Tab Overload (TO) comes in.

For the time being (and for the forseeable future) TO is just focused on doing shit that helps. It's not pretty.
It's not good.
It's not flexible.
It's a tool that aims to alleviate (not even fix) my specific problem with a bespoke solution.
YMMV.

Initially this tool did not use any libraries or build tooling.
I did this because I just need it to work for now and for the moment deciding between libs, frameworks, and tools is just too much work.
Has this changed?
Will it?
No one can say.
But probably not.
